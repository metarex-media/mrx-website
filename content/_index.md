{{% metarex %}} will create free Open Source software (**FOSS**) to handle media
metadata.

* [Backers](/docs/project/backers) put money in a pot
* The pot is used to fund the **FOSS**
* Everyone gets to build rich metadata driven applications that work seamlessly
  together with No-Code interoperability built in.
* On Set Virtualisation, QC cascading, Localisation, AI driven MAMs - it's all
  in scope
* Set the metadata free with [Metarex](/contact)
* [Read More](/docs/technology/) about the technology and [become a
  backer](/docs/project/backers/)
* [Sign up](/contact) to our newsletter if you want test files, spec updates or
  just want to see how Rexy evolves once the sun-tan is done.
* [Download](/downloads/samples/rexy_sunbathe_mrx.zip) a sample metarex file for
  Rexy's sunbathing scene. It has some issues that are being worked on. The
  [registration information](/ui/reg/MRX.123.456.789.def) is in the register and
  the [high level documentation](ui/reg/) in online.

{{% metarex %}} is like Fedex for metadata.

* **Sender**
  * The Sender wraps their metadata in a standardized container.
  * A label is applied to identify the contents
  * The mapper puts the container on a transport: NDI, ST 2110, email, FTP etc.
* **Receiver**
  * The receiver takes the containers from the transport
  * The unwrapper reads the label to handle the data as clocked / unclocked,
    text / binary
  * The unwrapper extracts the metadata and may use a web service to do something
    automatic with the data e.g. make an overlay / transcode to the receiver's
    preferred format.
  * The end user now has access to, potentially, several variants of the metadata
    before they write their first line of code.

<div class="header"> {{% metarex %}}.media Ltd. Organisation and Entity</div>
</div>

{{% metarex %}} is a UK Limited Company that exists for the following
reasons:

1. Raise funds to create the {{% metarex %}} Open Source Software
2. Maintain a board until end 2024
3. Maintain a website to run the project & communicate results
4. Publish the workplan to build the Software
5. Distribute funds to project grant applicants (companies & individuals)
6. Dissolve itself after 2 years at the boards discretion

### Board

A board of 3-7 members is initially created from the Gold Tier backers. The
company health is led by the Executive Director and the work is coordinated
by the Gold & Silver Tier backers.

### Work Plan

The work plan is managed in working groups that comprise small, targetted work
packages that result in:

1. Open Source Code including SDK, apps, schemas, encoding, registration &
   processing.
1. Open Source Hardware Definitions.
1. Public Domain Data (for testing, registration, operational use).
1. Specification documents - machine readable where possible.
1. A free to access register for public projects

### Timeframe

The initial backers, company incorpration, board and draft work plan will be in
place by 2022-12-31. First grant applications & proposals can be received
against the work plan 2023-01-01. Gantt Chart on the
[Project]({{< relref "docs/project" >}} "Project")
page.

The project will continue until 2024-12-31 and then be wound up by the board
leaving all code and open source content in place with a sustaining plan to
ensure it's longevity.
